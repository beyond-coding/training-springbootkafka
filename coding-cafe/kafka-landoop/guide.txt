All the service ports are exposed, and can be used from localhost / or within
your IntelliJ. The kafka broker is exposed by default at port 9092, zookeeper
at port 2181, schema registry at 8081, connect at 8083. As an example, to
access the JMX data of the broker run:

jconsole localhost:9581
If you want to have the services remotely accessible, then you may need to pass
in your machine's IP address or hostname that other machines can use to access
it:

docker run --rm --net=host -e ADV_HOST=<IP> landoop/fast-data-dev
Hit control+c to stop and remove everything

------------

docker run --rm --net=host --name kafka-landoop landoop/fast-data-dev
